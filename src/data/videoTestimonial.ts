        <p>I was an introvert and wanted to learn Digital Marketing, so I joined the 6 month course at Digital Academy 360. In the beginning, it was very difficult for me when the trainers asked us to present in class. I had no hope of completing the course because I used to get very nervous. But later, the trainers encouraged me a lot, and with their support, I improved. Eventually, I even won the Best Performer for Presentation award. After completing the course, I got placed as a Performance Marketer. It was a life changing experience for me.</p>
