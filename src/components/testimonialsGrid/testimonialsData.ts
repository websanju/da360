        <p>I was an introvert and wanted to learn Digital Marketing, so I joined the 6 month course at Digital Academy 360. In the beginning, it was very difficult for me when the trainers asked us to present in class. I had no hope of completing the course because I used to get very nervous. But later, the trainers encouraged me a lot, and with their support, I improved. Eventually, I even won the Best Performer for Presentation award. After completing the course, I got placed as a Performance Marketer. It was a life changing experience for me.</p>

      `<p>I joined Digital Academy 360 without completing my graduation and wasnâ€™t initially serious about the course or my career. I was often irregular to classes, but the trainers noticed and took the time to offer me valuable career guidance. Their encouragement made me realize the importance of the course, pushing me to become more focused and dedicated. From then on, I attended classes regularly and put in consistent effort to learn. With the skills and knowledge I gained, I successfully completed the course and have since built a career as a freelance digital marketer.</p>
